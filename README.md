Features:

Project Showcase: Explore my various projects with detailed descriptions and live demos.

Skills Highlight: Learn about my skills and expertise in different technologies and programming languages.


Extras:

One of the unique features of this portfolio website is the integration of GitHub coding challenge stats. By leveraging the GitHub REST API, the website dynamically fetches and displays statistics related to my coding challenges. This includes:

- HTML/CSS: For styling and structuring the website.
- JavaScript: For adding interactivity and functionality.
