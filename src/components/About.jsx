      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>
        I'm Kristina, your friendly, neighborhood, full-stack web developer and
        GIS nerd.
      </p>
      <p>
        I started my technical career as a GIS researcher for the city of Long
        Beach, analyzing and visualizing data to help make informed policy
        decisions. Hungry to learn more, I decided to take the plunge into web
        development and completed a coding bootcamp at El Camino College.
      </p>
      <p>
        I later accepted the opportunity to write technical content in the
        front-end and back-end, as well as mentoring over 800 students. I am
        passionate about helping others learn to code and am excited to continue
        my journey as a developer.
